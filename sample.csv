xswap-v3,XSwap Protocol V3,2022.0,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,"XSwap Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Xinfin network. It serves as an automated liquidity protocol that enables users to exchange various XRC-20 tokens without the need for a centralized intermediary or order book. XSwap operates as a decentralized exchange, meaning it doesn't rely on traditional order books. Instead, it utilizes liquidity pools to facilitate token swaps. Users can trade various Xinfin-based tokens directly from their wallets without the need for a centralized authority.  XSwap uses the concept of AMM, which involves using smart contracts to automate trading functions. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit pairs of tokens into smart contracts, creating liquidity pools. These pools are used to facilitate trades, with prices determined algorithmically based on the ratio of the two tokens in the pool. Users contribute to liquidity pools by depositing an equal value of two tokens into a smart contract. In return, they receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens, representing their share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time, along with a portion of the trading fees generated by the pool. XSwap uses a mathematical formula called the constant product formula (x * y = k) to determine the price of assets in a liquidity pool. The product of the quantities of the two tokens (x and y) remains constant, which allows for price adjustments as the ratio of tokens changes with each trade. Users can easily swap one XRC-20 token for another directly through XSwap's user interface or by interacting with its smart contracts. The trade is executed at the current market price determined by the AMM algorithm. XSwap is a permissionless and open-source protocol. Anyone can access and use the platform without requiring approval.  XSP is the governance token of the Uniswap protocol. Holders of UNI can participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals related to the protocol's development and parameters. XSwap serves as the first launchpad within the XDC network, providing a comprehensive suite of services including token creation, presale initiation, token and liquidity locker, and multisender functionality for all XRC20 tokens. Additionally, XSwap features a robust farming platform and extends its services to include a mobile wallet for user convenience. XSwap plays a pivotal role in the growth of decentralized finance by providing a user-friendly, permissionless, and efficient way for users to trade a wide variety of tokens directly from their wallets.",https://v3.xspswap.finance/,False,2.0,623.0,6.517076636708183,6.517076636708183,436199.87,436199.87,2.0,2024-06-14 08:34:58.428855

The essence of current versions of automated market makers is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k

Based on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k.

But current AMM performance could be significantly improved by rebuilding them on 
vastly more scalable architectures.

polkadex,Polkadex,2023.0,Estonia,"Launched in 2023, Polkadex Orderbook is an order book based decentralized exchange which combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized exchanges minus the disadvantages of both.   The result is an interoperable, non-custodial DEX with the speed, performance, and trading experience of a CEX. Or, as we like to call it, the CEXier DEX.   While remaining in full control of their funds at all times, traders are able to place limit and market orders in real-time using Polkadex Orderbook's CEX-like UI. Thanks to its integration with Humingbot, Polkadex Orderbook welcomes traders and market makers who prefer to automate their trading and implement advanced strategies.  Polkadex Orderbook listings are determined by PDEX holders via Polkadex's on-chain governance. Polkadex Orderbook’s 0.1% trading fees are accumulated by the Polkadex network and spent according to Polkadex governance.  Polkadex's custom-built interoperability solution, THEA, is a decentralized bridge designed to connect Polkadex Orderbook to networks and tokens beyond Polkadot. THEA is run by the Polkadex Network's 200 validators who are actively securing the network, making the bridge as secure as the chain itself.",https://orderbook.polkadex.trade,False,,1022.0,2.3663100094747676,0.0,0.00,158381.46,1.0,2024-06-14 08:34:58.428855
